<h3>CURRENT OPPORTUNITIES:</h3>

 

#UndocuJoy: Unfathomable Strength Opening Reception
Saturday, February 10
Volunteer Shift, 6:00 - 12:30am, 

Details: 

#UndocuJoy is a celebratory exhibition honoring the day-to-day spirit, passion, intelligence and resilience embodied by undocumented communities. With this group exhibition, we challenge the media’s collective archetype of undocumented people, which often conjures images of fear, despair and villains.

 During these trying times when the national immigration policy is at a peak, #UndocuJoy is a showcase of artists whose collective imagination document the joy and resilience exemplified in everyday life, while also chronicling our people as entrepreneurs, innovators, artists and leaders. #UndocuJoy is a love letter to those most affected by today’s policies (in this case, all of the artists) and an invitation for others to join our resistance.

Role: Volunteers will support in set up of main gallery for reception, assist in various elements throughout the event program, and help clean up the space at the end of the night.
